# Example Raw Ingestion Harness

This folder includes the standard retold harness pattern; because we wanted to
stress test the scale capabilities of this tech, a large amount of data was
required.

The data selected came from the US Department of Education, about Colleges.
Because the csv file is over 100 meg, the actual csv file has been explicitly
ignored in the `input` folder, so to run the harness as configured you will
need to decompress the zip file.
